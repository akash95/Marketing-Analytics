# Marketing / Media Mix Modeling

Employed Marketing/media mix modeling to propose a budget that is to be allocated across various advertisement channels for a cosmetic company.

Introduction :

A cosmetics company wants to determine the effectiveness of its advertising activities on sales of a product it launched four years ago. The goal is to gauge the effectiveness of their ad spending and propose a preliminary allocation model that the firm could use to guide its decision-making. I have applied three steps, attribution, optimization, and budget allocation in building the right model. Attribution quantifies the effects of each variable (advertising media) in driving sales; Optimization uses the elasticity of variables to run prediction scenarios toward marketing goals; last, budget allocation applies results from attribution and optimization and aids in allocating budgets across various advertising media to maximize sales. With our model, we selected four variables that have the most significant contribution to sales with regression analysis and it created numerous models in various combinations based on those variables to test for the best model. Then,  we reallocate the advertising budget by calculating the elasticity for each advertising media.

The purpose of using MMM (Marketing Mix Modelling) is to understand how much each marketing input variable contributes to sales, and how much to spend on each marketing input. MMM helps in identifying the effectiveness of each advertising media in terms of its Return on Investment.

Problem Formulation:
The business problem that is to be addressed:
1. How does this combination of ad exposures from various multimedia channels interact to influence this consumer?
2. Is the cosmetic company investing the right amounts at the right points in the customer-decision journey to spark the consumer's action which leads to sales?
